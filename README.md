# Hello! 👋

I like to work with feature branches and make small commits as I develop. I use pull requests to keep changes organized and to follow a clear workflow, even in my personal projects.

After merging a feature branch, I clean up the repository to keep it easy to navigate. Sometimes I keep branches for reference or for ongoing work.

My projects show how I write code, structure my workflow, and continue to improve as a developer.
Feel free to explore my repositories!
