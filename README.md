# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I often make many small commits during development on feature branches. Commits made on these branches don't appear in the activity graph until they are merged.

Recently, I have started using **squash merges** when merging feature branches into main, which combine all commits from that branch into a single commit. This means that only one commit from the entire branch appears in the activity graph.

To ensure a clear and clean commit history on main, I typically clean up branches after merging. However, I also keep some feature branches around when needed for reference or ongoing work.

Because of this, the activity graph may show fewer commits than the actual amount of work I put in.

I use pull requests and follow good development practices, even in my personal projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my code, workflow, and contributions!
