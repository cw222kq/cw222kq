# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I often make many small commits during development on feature branches. Commits made on these branches don't appear in the activity graph until they are merged.

When I merge a feature branch into main, I use **squash merges**, which combine all commits from that branch into a single commit. This means that only one commit from the entire branch appears in the activity graph.

Because of this, the activity graph may show fewer commits than the actual amount of work I put in.

I use pull requests and follow good development practices, even in my personal projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my code, workflow, and contributions!
