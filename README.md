# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I usually make many small commits during development, but when I merge to main, I squash them into a single commit to keep the history clean and easy to read.

Because of this, the activity graph may show fewer commits than my actual work output.

I use pull requests and follow good development practices, even in my personal projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my code and workflow!
